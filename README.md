# kai9987kai.github.io is my website 

This is my website hosted on github, on this site, there are pages for my projects and social media accounts e.g youtube channels and Instagram accounts also I use this site to store screenshots of my programs for Promotional reasons and projects as well as other photos I need to store On this website. There are some random things and some very relevant things because there is not one thing that I need this site for.
